# daily-algo-mem
going to be trying to implement algorithms once per day for some time to remember them better.

i'm using [this](https://github.com/catfoodeater/random-choice) to pick what algorithm to implement.

| Day | Algorithm | Complete | Time |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Binary search | ✅ | N/a |
| 2 | Bubble sort | ✅ | <5m |
